Bingo Cards for my Spanish class

### Why do this?
I made this project because in my Spanish 2 class, we have been learning about different foods.  First we started learning about the fruits.  One of the activities that was assigned to us was to make a 4X5 bingo card.  Everyone else in the class had to make it on paper, but since that is more difficult for me because of my disability, and I didn't just want to do another assignment on Google Docs, I decided to make a website.  I had been getting back into programming and had been working through a web development course on Udemy so I said why not.
